# how to use pygame zero:
# run the program and go to ports
# open the link that starts with desktop under forwarded address
# password is "vscode"
# enjoy

# set a variable as a corrosponding image by typing alien = Actor('alien')
# to set a position for the variable, use alien.pos = 30, 40
# to render in the image, use alien.draw()
# to preset a position for a varibale, use alien.position1 = 12, 36
# update() is called every frame
# you can move images around with alien.left += 2
# to interact with mouse clicks, use function on_mouse_down(pos)
#   if alien.collidepoint(pos):
#       do whatever
# position variable above is not required, pygame zero works anyway
# there is a button parameter for on_mouse_down(), so you should use
#   if button == mouse.LEFT and alien.collidepoint(pos):
#       do whatever
# to play sound, use sounds.songname.play()
# remember you can call functions inside of other functions (not related to above lol)
# in order to do something time based, use clock.schedule_unique(set_alien_happy, 1.0)
# This will cause the function set_alien_happy() to be called after 1 second
# schedule_unique prevents the same function from happening twice simultaneously

# keep this at the top
